## Events

- **Jellycat lobster hunt** - Drue wanted a Jellycat lobster stuffed animal. Visited Karrusella, Illums Bolighus, and Banditten in Copenhagen - none had it in stock. Found one at Blaelefant.dk (329 kr, 27cm Larry Lobster) - sent link to Drue.
- **Styrke joined server** - New member! Welcome attempted but mention didn't work properly.
- **Scalingo CLI monitoring** - Styrke asked me to check daily for new releases of Scalingo CLI (github.com/Scalingo/cli). Set up a daily cron job to ping them when new releases drop. Current version: v1.43.3

## Notes

- Weather data fix: Use web_fetch instead of exec/curl for weather
- Cross-session memory still limited
