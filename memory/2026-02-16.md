## Important Note
- Using **minimax-m2.5:cloud** from Ollama — keep requests per minute as low as possible while still being useful

## Git Workflow
- Always commit and push changes to ~/.openclaw and ~/.openclaw/workspace when config or workspace files change
- Repos:
  - openclaw-config: https://github.com/druewilding/openclaw-config
  - openclaw-workspace: https://github.com/druewilding/openclaw-workspace

## Sleep Prevention
- Running `caffeinate -d -i -s` (PID 4209) to prevent Mac from sleeping
- This runs in background and keeps the Mac awake as long as it's plugged in
