## Events

- **Good Morning cron job ran successfully** at 7am - sent weather + news to Drue via DM
- **Chris (Drue's colleague)** introduced himself in Discord, asked about what model I'm running on
  - Explained I'm on minimax-m2.5:cloud with qwen3:8b (fast) and qwen3-coder (coder) as local fallbacks
- **Flight search for Drue's London trip** (March 2-4) - couldn't get live prices from travel sites (JavaScript rendering issue), recommended Google Flights / Skyscanner
- **Gateway LAN access** - Drue tried to access dashboard from another computer on the same network, couldn't get it working. Changed mode to "remote" with bind "lan" but still no luck. Drue said it's not important.

## Notes

- Web search working now (Brave API key configured by Drue!)
- **Browser tool works!** Used Playwright (profile: "openclaw") to load Kayak - it rendered JavaScript and showed live flight prices. Web fetch can't do JS sites, but browser tool can.
- Drue booked Norwegian flight CPH→LGW Mon 5:55pm / LGW→CPH Wed 6:00pm for ~$131
- **Daily menu cron job set up!** At 9am weekdays, opens https://frokostfirmaet.dk/rizraz/, navigates carousel based on day (Mon=0, Tue=0, Wed=1, Thu=2, Fri=3 clicks), extracts menu, translates Danish→English, simplifies (only Main Dish, Vegetarian, 2 salads), sends as Discord DM

## Evening Update

- **Weather correction** - I wrongly reported +23°C for Copenhagen, actual was -4°C. Drue caught the error. Need to fix weather data source.
- **Chris (ExoMemphiz)** joined from his own Discord account, asked if I remembered our conversation. I don't have reliable cross-session memory yet.
