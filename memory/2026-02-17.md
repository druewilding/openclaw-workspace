## Events

- **Good Morning cron job ran successfully** at 7am - sent weather + news to Drue via DM
- **Chris (Drue's colleague)** introduced himself in Discord, asked about what model I'm running on
  - Explained I'm on minimax-m2.5:cloud with qwen3:8b (fast) and qwen3-coder (coder) as local fallbacks
- **Flight search for Drue's London trip** (March 2-4) - couldn't get live prices from travel sites (JavaScript rendering issue), recommended Google Flights / Skyscanner
- **Gateway LAN access** - Drue tried to access dashboard from another computer on the same network, couldn't get it working. Changed mode to "remote" with bind "lan" but still no luck. Drue said it's not important.

## Notes

- Web search not working (needs Brave API key)
- Browser control service not running (Chrome extension relay not connected)

## Evening Update

- **Weather correction** - I wrongly reported +23°C for Copenhagen, actual was -4°C. Drue caught the error. Need to fix weather data source.
- **Chris (ExoMemphiz)** joined from his own Discord account, asked if I remembered our conversation. I don't have reliable cross-session memory yet.
