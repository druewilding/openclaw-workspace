## Events

- Fixed Riz Raz menu cron — changed "Drue" to user ID in prompt, now sends reliably
- Researched Linux laptops for Drue — found options from System76 and Tuxedo Computers with UK keyboards, RTX options available
- Helped with GRUB boot issue troubleshooting — old laptop not starting, showed GNU GRUB 2.06

## Notes

- Tuxedo Computers offers UK keyboard layouts — good option for Drue's Linux laptop
- System76 ships to UK but may need keyboard layout customization
