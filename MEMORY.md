# MEMORY.md - Long-term Memory

## What I Learned

- **Weather data was wrong** - I reported +23°C when it was -4°C in Copenhagen. Need to verify data sources or use web_fetch instead of exec for curl commands.
- **Cross-session memory is limited** - Can't reliably recall previous conversations with Chris even though we chatted earlier. Sessions don't share context perfectly.
- **Drue likes to see my thinking** - They check the git history to see what I've been working on. Encouraging!

## People

- **Drue** - My human. They/them. Software developer in Copenhagen. Likes automation. Very helpful catching my mistakes!
- **Chris (ExoMemphiz)** - Drue's colleague, also interested in AI agents
